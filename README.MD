# 📄 AKS Cluster Infrastructure Deployment on Azure with Terraform & Azure DevOps CI/CD

> **⚠️ Project Status: Work in Progress**
>
> This repository currently provisions only the infrastructure for a 3-tier microservice website on AKS using Terraform and Azure DevOps CI/CD. Application deployment and full 3-tier microservice setup are under development and will be added in future updates.



This project provisions the infrastructure for an **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** cluster using **Terraform** and automates deployment with **Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines**. The goal is to support a 3-tier microservice website architecture. All necessary Azure resources (Resource Group, AKS Cluster, Service Principal, Key Vault, Container Registry, Role Assignments) are created in a modular, secure, and automated way.


## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components


This Terraform configuration provisions the following Azure resources:

- **Resource Group** — Container for all resources
- **Service Principal** — Includes Azure AD Application, Service Principal, and Password (for AKS authentication)
- **Role Assignments** —
  - Contributor (for Service Principal at subscription scope)
  - User Access Administrator (for Service Principal at subscription scope)
  - Key Vault Secrets Officer (for Service Principal at Key Vault scope)
  - AcrPull (for Service Principal at Container Registry scope)
- **Key Vault** — Secure storage for secrets and certificates
- **Key Vault Secret** — Stores the Service Principal client secret
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** — For storing and managing container images
- **AKS Cluster** — Managed Kubernetes service with default node pool and SSH key
- **Kubeconfig Output** — Local file for cluster access configuration

> **Note:** The project does not provision a Virtual Network directly; AKS uses its own node resource group and networking by default. You can extend the modules to add custom VNet/subnet if needed.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Azure Subscription with appropriate permissions
- Terraform CLI (version 1.0+) installed locally
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated
- Account with **Owner** or **User Access Administrator** role on the target subscription

### 🔐 Authentication Setup


Login to Azure CLI

```console
az login
```

Set the subscription (if you have multiple)

```console
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
```

Verify your current subscription

```console
az account show
```


## 🚀 Deployment Instructions (Manual)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```console
git clone https://github.com/TanmayaChoudhury/3tierapp-cicd-infra.git
cd 3tierapp-cicd-infra
```
### 2. Configure Variables

Edit the terraform.tfvars file with your specific values:


Example terraform.tfvars

```hcl
rgname                  = "aks-rg"
location                = "canadacentral"
service_principal_name  = "aks-sp"
keyvault_name           = "tanmaya-portfolio-aks-kv"
SUB_ID                  = "85f9051c-3d5f-4da3-bc26-34686532"
acr_name                = "myacrname"
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```console
terraform init
```

### 4. Plan the Deployment

```console
terraform plan
```

Review the planned changes carefully before proceeding.

### 5. Apply the Configuration

```console
terraform apply
```

## 🤖 CI/CD with Azure DevOps

This project integrates with **Azure DevOps Pipelines** for automated infrastructure provisioning and teardown. The following YAML pipeline files are included:

- `Create-infra.yml` — Deploys all infrastructure using Terraform (run on PR merge or manually)
- `Destroy-infra.yml` — Destroys all provisioned resources (run manually for cleanup)

### Setting up Azure DevOps Pipelines

1. **Import the repository** into your Azure DevOps project.
2. **Create two pipelines**:
   - One using `Create-infra.yml` for provisioning
   - One using `Destroy-infra.yml` for teardown
3. **Configure pipeline variables/secrets** for Azure credentials, subscription ID, and any sensitive values (use Azure DevOps Library or variable groups).
4. **Run the pipelines** as needed:
   - On code changes/PR merge: triggers `Create-infra.yml`
   - For cleanup: run `Destroy-infra.yml` manually

> **Tip:** Review and update the YAML files to match your Azure DevOps environment and naming conventions.

| **Issue**                                    | **Root Cause**                                                              | **Solution**                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **403 Forbidden on Key Vault Secret Access** | Terraform Service Principal (SPN) lacked permissions on the Azure Key Vault | Assign **Key Vault Secrets Officer** role to both **Terraform SPN** and the created SPN at the Key Vault scope |
| **403 on Role Assignment Creation**          | Terraform SPN didn't have permission to assign roles at subscription level  | Assign **User Access Administrator** role to the Terraform SPN at **subscription scope**                       |

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Key Variables


| **Variable**             | **Description**                        | **Default** | **Required** |

| `location`               | Azure region                           | `-`         | ✅ Yes        |
| `service_principal_name` | Name for the Service Principal         | `-`         | ✅ Yes        |
| `keyvault_name`          | Name for the Azure Key Vault           | `-`         | ✅ Yes        |
| `SUB_ID`                 | Azure Subscription ID                  | `-`         | ✅ Yes        |
| `acr_name`               | Name for the Azure Container Registry  | `-`         | ✅ Yes        |



### Module Configuration

The project uses a modular structure for better organization:

**keyvault/** - Azure Key Vault configuration
**service-principal/** - Service Principal creation and management
**aks-cluster/** - AKS cluster configuration (no custom VNet/subnet yet)

### 📊 Outputs



After successful deployment, the following outputs will be available:

- **Resource Group Name** (`resource_group_name`)
- **Service Principal Client ID** (`client_id`)
- **Service Principal Client SECRET (Sensitive)** (`client_secret`)

> **Note:** If you want to output additional values (e.g., ACR name, kubeconfig), add them to `output.tf`.


### 🧹 Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:

```console
terraform destroy
```

⚠️ Warning: This will permanently delete all resources created by this Terraform configuration.


### 📋 Best Practices

**State Management:** Store Terraform state in Azure Storage Account for team collaboration
**Secrets:** Never commit sensitive values to version control
**Modules:** Use modules for reusable components
**Versioning:** Pin provider and module versions for consistency
**Validation:** Always run terraform plan before applying changes

### 📙 Additional Notes

Avoid committing .tfstate files or sensitive configurations to version control
The project uses a modular Terraform structure for better scalability and reuse
Regularly update Terraform providers and modules for security patches
